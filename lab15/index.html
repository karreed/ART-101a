			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to use an api and get data from it and output in html using AJAX</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had issues with certain api's, some api's were very easy to work with and the urls worked fine while some of the api's we could not get to work. I got the pokemon api to work but not with the way we did during lecture but the dad joke worked fine with the lecture method.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I never really used apis or AJAX so everything was pretty new to me. It was the most challenging lab for me so far because before the lecture I did not know what AJAX was and when working with it I wasn't sure what does what. After the lab it doesn't seem as challenging anymore and I should be able to implement api's into the final project.</p>
