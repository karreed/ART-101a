			<h1>Lab 6 - Array and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create an array and an object in javascript. We created an array of tranportations and printed it in console and we created on object of our main ride and gave the object properties. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problems we ran into was missing punctuations like brackets or parenthesis which would give us syntax errors. It was pretty easy to solve once you realize you made the mistake because we would just quickly add the missing bracket or delete any extra. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab was easy to understand as my partner and I had understanding of arrays and objects from previous coding experience. Creating the objects was fairly simple  </p>
