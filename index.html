					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>My name is Jonathan Au. I am a third-year agpm major. I have taken coding classes in the past, but I wouldn't say I am the most experience. I know my way around it a bit. I am born and raised in San Francisco. My favorite foods are sushi and burritos. In my free time I play a lot of videogames. I mainly play FPS games because thats what a majority of my friends play but I enjoy single player games as well. My current favorite FPS game is Rainbow Six Siege. It's a pretty unique title in the FPS genre but it is difficult to learn. My favorite video games series is The Legend of Zelda, I really like the mix of puzzle solving with fighting enemies. I also really like Pokemon and Persona which are turn-based rpgs. I am on the look out for more metroidvania style games because I tried playing some in the past but it did not really click with me until I played metroid dread which was incredibly fun. I don't really like travelling much, but my mom likes travelling a lot so I have been travelling with her. The photo on the left is taken at the French Quarters in New Orleans.</p>
