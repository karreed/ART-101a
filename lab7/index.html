			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create a function with a partner that can take user input and return it in reverse. The function could also return the input in various other different ways.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was running into the problem where the windows prompt would pop up twice, but my partner told me the fix was that the javascript file was being linked twice and removing one of them would fix the issue.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab was fairly simple, we did not run into any issues when creating and running the functions.</p>
			</div>
