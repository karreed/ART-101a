			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create file structures and learning how to link to other files. We needed to create index.html and link to images within index.html. The lab also had us link our labs to our homepage and vice versa.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problem I ran into was trying to format columns into my lab and homepage. I eventually figured it out through google and trial and error. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I have gotten the pages to a point where I am satisfied but there are still a little more changes I would like to add in the future. Overall, the lab was not that difficult as I already had a good understanding of file structures. It terms of aesthetic I did the most I could do, its more of I am not sure what aesthetic direction I want to go with so I went with a pale color for my homepage. I spent most of the time trying to make columns within my page which took a lot of effort because it wasn't splitting how I wanted but eventually I got there.</p>
