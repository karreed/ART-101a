					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to append new elements to output div with javascript and jQuery scripts</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We did not run into any issues with the lab. We understood the material well and all the steps were easy to follow and do. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Before starting the lab I thought it would be a little more difficult because I am not that familiar with libraries and jQuery but after starting the lab and following along with lecture content the lab was simple and quick to do. </p>
