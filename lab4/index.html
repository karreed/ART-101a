				<p>Rock Paper Scissors</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Take input from player</li>
					<li>Player can choose from rock paper or scissors, validate user input</li>
					<li>Computer generates their move.</li>
					<li>Evaluate possible combinations</li>
					<li>If the combination is the same it is a tie and the player puts a new input.</li>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to create pseduocode and understand how pseudocode is helpful to better understand problems.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems I ran into were some of the steps with the instructions. I wasn't really sure what the pre code stuff was and what we were supposed to do but after messing around with it for a bit it looked correct.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment was simple and easy to understand. It was a little tedious to write down every step but it is necessary to understand the steps of coding. I have some experience with coding so I knew about the concept of pseudocode so I did not run into any issues with writing the pseudocode</p>

					<p>pseudocode on how to play Apex Legends</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Turn on the computer</li>
							<li>Log into the user</li>
							<li>Open up Steam app</li>
							<li>Log into Steam</li>
							<li>Navigate to the library tab</li>
							<li>Locate Apex Legends in the library tab</li>
							<li>Click the launch button on the apex legends page</li>
							<li>Left click on the mouse to go to the main menu</li>
							<li>Choose the gamemode you want to play in the bottom left corner</li>
							<li>Click the “Ready” button located in the bottom left corner</li>
							<li>Choose a legend</li>
							<li>Determine where to land</li>
							<li>Press space to leave the drop ship</li>
							<li>When you land at a designated area, find loot and weapons</li>
							<li>If you are not in the zone, move into the safe zone</li>
							<li>If other players land in the same spot as you, quickly search for a weapon to kill the enemies</li>
							<li>Loot the enemy's bodies and you kill them</li>
							<li>If there are enemies in the zone you can choose to engage or disengage</li>
							<li>Repeat previous step until you die or win the game</li>
