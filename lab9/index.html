					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to create a button using javascript libraries and jQuery</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This weeks lab we ran into an issue where the css class special was not changing the attributes of the id's that we made. I wasn't really sure what was going on in the beginning and why it wasn't working and when looking at the console to see what was going on we figured out that the class special was not overriding the values set by the original class. We searched on google to see how to override the original class and it said to add !important and the end of the values. We tested it after and it worked but I am curious to see what other ways we can approach the solution</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was more challenging because we ran into an issue that we could not figure out on our own and it took a while for us to figure out the issue and solution. In the end we did figure it out but it still feels like an improper solution and we would like to figure out whether the solution we came up with was what was intended or if there is another solution or and issue with the way we wrote our code. We followed the steps from the lab and it wasn't working properly for us but the bonus task was a lot more simple and we actually got the bonus to work before the task 3 method.</p>
