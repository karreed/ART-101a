			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab is to create loops that output phrases when the loop reaches certain numbers</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems with the lab. It was straight forward and it was all covered in the lecture so we did the lab pretty quickly </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab was pretty simple and easy to understand. I never really had any issues with loops and the loop we were making in the lab was not too</p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
